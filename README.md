# progress-boilerplate
My personal boilerplate for full-stack JS projects based on how I learned to develop full-stack JS.

**Note:** Make sure you have Node.js installed!

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/MorganCAw/progressive-js-boilerplate.git`
2. Checkout the branch you want `npm install`
3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` for that branch!

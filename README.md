# progressive-js-boilerplate
My personal boilerplate for full-stack JS projects based on how I learned to
develop full-stack JS.

**Note:** Make sure you have Node.js installed!

## Starting with React.js
So this branch isn't really reflective of how I started with React. I learned
React by plunging in head first and basically jumbled everything together up
until the cumulation of all the other progressive branches.

## Setting up the project
1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/MorganCAw/progressive-js-boilerplate.git`
2. Checkout the branch you want `npm install`
3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` for that branch!

## Running the project
1. [Express.js](https://github.com/MorganCAw/progressive-js-boilerplate/tree/expressjs)
2. [React.js](https://github.com/MorganCAw/progressive-js-boilerplate/tree/reactjs)
3. ~~Transpiling~~
4. ~~Webpack~~
5. ~~Hotloading~~

Up until the Webpack branch, the project is cumulative. The rest are all technologies that I have experimented with building off of the [Hotloading](#) branch above.
